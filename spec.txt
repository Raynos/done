Items in the To Do tree are represented as nested HTML '<ul>' elements.

Focus (joint 2)
Currently selected item has an editable textbox with current text.

Deleting items (7)
Backspace when item is empty. Focus then moves to item visually above it.

New items (1)
Press enter on an existing item, to create an item below it.
The new item has the same depth.

Navigation (joint 2)
Up, down to move focus between items (regardless of depth)

Indentation (3)
Ctrl+Left,  Ctrl+Right to indent or unindent the subtree
The first child of a parent can't be indented (it doesn't make sense)
Outdent item makes it successor sibling of current parent

Reordering (5)
Ctrl+up, Ctrl+down - moves item up or down visually.
Item becomes indented to depth of item below new position.
Subtree follows moved item, with same relative indentation as before moving

Collapsing (6)
Ctrl+space

Marking complete (4)
Initially every element has a light red background
Pressing Ctrl+D causes it to be marked as completed, with a green background.
If all children of a parent item become complete, the parent is marked as completed.
If a child becomes uncompleted, the parent is then marked as uncompleted.
(A parent whose children are all marked as complete may be re-marked as uncompleted even if all children are completed)
